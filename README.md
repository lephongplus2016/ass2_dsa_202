My assignment 2 in dsa semester 202

## Student Outcomes
After completing this assignment, students will be able to
* explain how a cache works
* apply AVL tree to search in a simple cache
## Introduction
In a real computer machine, the speed of the main memory is very low in
comparison with the speed of its processor. To improve the performance, a fast
cache memory is used to reduce the processor’s time waiting when accessing
instructions and data in main memory. The cache stores copies of the data
from the main memory so that future requests for that data can be served
faster.
## How it works
When the processor firstly references a memory slot in the main memory, the
content of the memory slot together with its address are put into the cache.
Subsequently, when the processor references the memory slot again, the desired
contents are read directly from the fast cache instead of the slow main memory.
## Cache replacement Policies
As the size of a cache is limited, when the cache is full and a new data is
inserted into the cache for future requests, an existing data in the cache must
be selected by the cache replacement policy and it is removed to have place for
the new data. There are many cache replacement policies, some of which are
listed as below:
* FIFO (First In First Out): the oldest data is selected
* LIFO (Last In First Out): the newest data is selected
* LRU (Least Recently Used): the least recently used data is selected
* MSU (Most Recently Used): the most recently used data is selected
* LFU (Least Frequently Used): the least frequently used data is selected
* RR (Random Replacement): a random data is selected
